# Daily Affirmation

### Inspiration
There's real power in positive thinking â€” and that's a fact backed by science. 
Practicing self-affirmation regularly can actually reduce stress levels and set up successful outcomes in the real world.
I got inspired by the daily affirmation video on youtube and created this website. 
(If you don't know what daily affirmation is, you can check this video here: [Daily Affirmation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT6ASPy2Dbs&t=164s))


### Short Introduction
This app project is a static website that is made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript only. 
This is the first project I made during studying full-stack development at Codeacademy.


### Purpose of this app
The main purpose of the website is to provide a daily positive affirmation to the user based on their name and date of birth.
Users are recommended to post the sentence on a wall where they can see it frequently, or write it down at the top of their daily to-do list.
By doing so, they can get positive energy from their unconscious mind which will lead to good results in their real life.


### How to start

### Important features

- User can only get one affirmation per day. When the user tries to get more affirmations, the warning sentence will pop out.

### What I learned from this project
- How to make a website interactable by using DOM and JavaScript. For example, using the onclick function to display or hide the setting component and using the if condition to trigger a warning sentence.
- Responsive design on landscape and different types of mobile devices.
